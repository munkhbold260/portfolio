                I'm a passionate,
                <span className="underline">self-proclaimed designer</span> who
                specializes in full stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am
                very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual
                aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel
                perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant
                code matters to me.

                I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then,
                I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
                challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
                Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web
                development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications
                using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs,
                Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on
                products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.
              </p>

                When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering
                around on twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the journey of
                early startups or enjoying some free time. You can follow me on
                <span className="underline">Twitter</span> where I share
                tech-related bites and build in public, or you can follow me on
                <span className="underline">GitHub.</span>
              </p>
